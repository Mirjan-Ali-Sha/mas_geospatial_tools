# The plugin is auto-disabling, which means it's crashing during initialization.
# 
# To find the error:
# 
# 1. In QGIS, go to: View → Panels → Log Messages (or press Ctrl+5)
# 2. In the Log Messages panel, select the "Plugins" tab (or "Python" tab)
# 3. Enable the plugin again while watching the log panel
# 4. Look for red error messages when it crashes
# 
# Copy ALL error messages that appear, especially ones mentioning:
# - mas_geospatial_tools
# - ImportError
# - ModuleNotFoundError
# - AttributeError
# - Traceback
# 
# The error will tell us exactly which file/algorithm is causing the crash.
